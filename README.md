# Chatty
Chatty is a demo app written in TypeScript using React, Redux and Socket.io.

It allows anyone connected to the app to exchange messages with other people. It does not store messages, which are instead stored in the browser, and does not encrypt messages.

The server code is here [https://github.com/paolo-projects/chatty-server](https://github.com/paolo-projects/chatty-server)
